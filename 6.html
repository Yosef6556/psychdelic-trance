    Minimal techno is a subgenre of techno music. It is characterized by a stripped-down 
    aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition and understated development. 
    Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s 
    by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.[3][4] By the early 2000s 
    he term 'minimal' generally described a style of techno that was popularized
     in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others.

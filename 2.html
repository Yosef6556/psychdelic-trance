    <h1>tempo</h1><hr>
    In musical terminology, tempo (Italian, 'time'; plural tempos, or tempi from the Italian plural) 
    is the speed or pace of a given piece. In classical music, tempo is typically indicated with an instruction 
    at the start of a piece (often using conventional Italian terms) and is usually measured in beats per minute (or bpm).
     In modern classical compositions, a "metronome mark" in beats per minute may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking,
     while in modern genres like electronic dance music, tempo will typically simply be stated in BPM.
     Tempo may be separated from articulation and meter, or these aspects may be indicated along with tempo,
      all contributing to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a vital skill for a musical performer, 
      tempo is changeable. Depending on the genre of a piece of music and the performers' interpretation, 
      a piece may be played with slight tempo rubato or drastic variances. In ensembles, 
      the tempo is often indicated by a conductor or by one of the instrumentalists, for instance the drummer.

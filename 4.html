    Dark psytrance (also known as dark psychedelic trance, dark psy, darkpsy or dark trance)
     is the heavier end of the psychedelic trance spectrum with tempos starting from around 150 bpm,
      but may often go faster. Characterized by having obscure, deep, and more eschatological background 
      that leads into profound meditation of death, night, and transcendence, often with dismal sounds and heavy basslines.
       The subgenre often samples horror films in contrast to the science fiction film samples more regularly used in "normal" psytrance.
        Dark psytrance emerged as a recognizable genre after 2003 in Germany and Russia,[2][17] with Brazilian, 
        German and Russian artists dominating the scene.[18] The German artist Xenomorph (Mark Petrick) is credited
         as an artist who first brought dark occult aesthetic into psytrance, with his album Cassandra's Nightmare 
         released in 1998 being a major influence on the subgenre; X-Dream's Radio is another 1998 album cited as an early influence.

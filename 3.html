    Full on Trance is one of the must eminent forms of Psychedelic Trance. Evolving big bass lines (which are planted as two or three short bass notes in between each hit of the 4/4 drum), with catchy hooks but contains fast changes in music sequence (a maximum of 32 beats per sequence), and some borderline commercial and pop elements aside its special melodic and uplifting nature.
The name Full On was chosen to define this genre even though no one is not sure why, some say that the name is delivered from a phrase often used to describe uplifting and energetic music (“That tune is freaking Full On !!!”).
While others say that the source of the name is from the “Full Moon” festivals.
On the other hand, some people claim that the expression Full On is taken from the name of the first album released under Hom Mega productions in 1998, titled Full On, which comes from English slang.
Furthermore, this sub genre of the Psychedelic Trance has the biggest demand by fans. Full Of music was first established in Israel in the late 1990s.

Full on is usually played at clubs or during the sunrise and morning hours at festivals, when the crowd is hyperactive and asks for fast and furious music to smash the ground with.
